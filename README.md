PWG Semantic Model 3.0
======================

The PWG Semantic Model inherits the model and semantics of the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) and was created to enable interfaces and data exchange between different imaging systems.

This repository was used by the (now inactive) Semantic Model workgroup of the IEEE-ISTO Printer Working Group standards organization to manually develop the third major version of an XML schema representing a semantic data model of imaging systems - print, scan, fax, copy in local, enterprise, mobile and cloud environments.  It has been superseded by an automated tool created in the Internet Printing Protocol workgroup which can create XML schema directly from the IANA IPP registry.
